6. Click **Restart** to restart Home Assistant

### Method B: Manual Download
1. Download latest release from [OpenGrowBox GitHub](https://github.com/your-repo/OpenGrowBox)
2. Extract to `/config/custom_components/opengrowbox/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Step 2: Add Integration

## Step 3: Configure Room

**One Integration = One Complete Room**

### Basic Room Setup
```
Room Name: My Grow Room          # Your room name

```

### Automatic Device Management
**OpenGrowBox handles everything automatically:**

✅ **Creates room/area** in Home Assistant  
✅ **Discovers all connected devices**  
✅ **Proper naming and labeling**

## Step 4: Plant Setup

### Plant Configuration (Web Interface)
After integration is added, access the OpenGrowBox configuration through:

- **Home Assistant → Integrations → OpenGrowBox → Configure**
- **Or directly through any OGB device card**

### Basic Settings
```
Plant Type: Cannabis                # Dropdown: Cannabis, Tomato, Pepper, Lettuce
Growth Stage: EarlyVeg             # Auto-detected with visual indicators
Plant Count: 4                    # Number of plants in room
Container Size: 50L               # Growing container size
```
